__This isnt event my final form !__  
Alot of my stuff is hosted on my [forgejo instance.](https://code.booklordofthe.dev)  
Stuff that is still here is to make it easier for people to collaborate and to allow faster downloads.

### Stuff I care about:

- __Beef:__ A compiled programming language with manual memory management, and C# like syntax
- __Free software:__ Alot of my code is licensed so that you will likely be able to use it if you want
- __Reinventing existing stuff:__ To allow me to understand how things work and to make things how I like them
- __Video Games:__ They offer some really interesting challenges in performant programming and code patterns
