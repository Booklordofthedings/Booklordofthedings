# Hello Im Jannis von Hagen   

I am still a highschool student and havent decided on a field of computer science that I want to work in,
although Game- and Webdevelopment are two of the things that I really like so far.

The Languagues I use are C#, Js, HTMl, CSS and Beeflang, but I want to learn more in the future.

You can contact me in various different ways and locations:
