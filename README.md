## Oh, Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Booklordofthedings and this is my Github profile.  
Most of my relevant stuff is now hosted on Forgejo at [Booklordofthe.dev](https://code.booklordofthe.dev).
Until Forgejo implements federation, stuff that others might want to help with will be hosted on here.  
If you want to help with the stuff thats only hosted on my Forgejo just send me a message and I see what I can do there.

## Stuff thats kindof relevant
